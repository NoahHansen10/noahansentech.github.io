  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h1>Skills</h1>
  <p>CI have had a passion for technology since a young age, with a particular interest in handheld devices and smartphones. This passion deepened in 5th grade when I received a Raspberry Pi for Christmas, which sparked an interest in building custom Minecraft servers and experimenting with networking, API development, and website building.

As I entered high school, I continued to explore various aspects of computer science, programming, and networking. I took classes in computer science and programming, built my own gaming PC, and kept up to date with new technologies. My interest in cyber security and hacking emerged during my junior year of high school and I switched to using Linux full-time. I honed my skills by participating in online Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and built a home lab environment with my roommate. Additionally, in 2020, I earned my COMPTIA A+ certification, which further solidified my knowledge and understanding of computer hardware and software.

I am currently a student at Michigan Technological University, pursuing a degree in Cyber Security with a concentration in Network Security. I am excited to continue developing my knowledge and skills in the field and to see where my passion for technology will take me in the future.</p>
