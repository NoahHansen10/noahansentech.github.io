### Primary Information
This website is free for anyone to use or fork for their own uses. Deployment is handled through GitHub pages, but can also be done using cloud flare pages if you have a domain though them. 

because this website runs primarily though JS and HTML and doesn't have a real back-end, it is easy to host and also test local environments. my preferred is just using a basic python3 web server which can be done though 

`python3 -m http.server`

ensuring that you are in the root of the project.
