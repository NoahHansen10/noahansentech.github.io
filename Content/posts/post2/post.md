# OnePlus 8 Wireless Charging Mod
### June 7, 2022

## Introduction:

I have had my OnePlus 8 for a while now and I have been loving it. The only thing that I have been missing is wireless charging
which is something that I have had on my previous phones. So I decided to do something about it. I had recently gotten a soldering
iron and I thought that it really shouldn't be that hard to add wireless charging since you can by usb adapters for it. So all
I would need to do is cut up one of those adapters and solder it to the battery terminals. 

## The Process:

I started by taking a hair dryer to the back of my phone to loosen the adhesive that was holding the back on. Once I had the back off 
I started to take out some screws that were holding the battery in place. Once I had the NFC and flashlight assembly out 
I started carfully probing contact points on the motherboard to see if I could find a place to solder the positive and negative
leads to from the charge controller. I found a debugging pad that was getting +4.1V while charging and nominal voltage while
discharging so I decided to use that as my entry point. I then had to plan out where not just my coil but also the Qi combatable 
controller would fit. As it was the one thing I could not account for the thickness of. I ended up having to cut a hole in the plastic
surrounding the flashlight ribbon cable to make room for the small rectangular controller. I then had to solder the controllers 
leads to the phones motherboard and attach the coil to the back of the phone. I then had to put the partially back togeather to 
test it,

## Conclusion:
This project was an excellent exploration into my technical skills and problem solving. I learned many things on problem solving on small circuit boards. 

All in all it was a fun project that ran as my primary device for almost 6 months without any major issues.
