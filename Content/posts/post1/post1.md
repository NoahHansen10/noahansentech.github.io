# My First Post
### August 27, 2023

When I originally designed my website I wanted to make it as simple as possible just to see what I could come up with, and now it has expanded quite a bit.

Back awhile ago I decided that I wanted to have the ability to has support for rich text without the need for writing the 
html myself. So I decided to use markdown. I had already been using markdown for my notes along with GitHub docs and 
I thought it would be a good idea to use it for my website as well.

When it came to the actual development of this website, I originally started with a locally hosted WordPress site, but 
after some time I decided that it really wasn't as much fun as doing it myself. So using what I had come up with originally
as a template I started to build my own website from scratch. As I continued to work the list of things I wanted it to be
able to do kept getting longer and longer. I wanted to not just have my site be a resume but also be a place where I could 
write about different things that I am interested in and have it be a place where I could share my projects. I also wanted 
something that was easy to update and maintain for a long time. So for hosting I decided to use GitHub Pages in combination 
with CloudFlare pages to host my site.

While I am still adding many features to this site I am happy with how it has turned out so far. I am excited to see where
it goes in the future.
