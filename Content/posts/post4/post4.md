# Database Project
##### October 18th 2023

## Introduction:
For my school project, I designed and built a functional, publicly routable website using Supabase for the database. The frontend was hosted on Cloudflare Pages, providing a user-friendly interface. To securely handle keys and authentication, I wrote an API within a Cloudflare Worker, which served as the interface between the static frontend and the database. While scalability was not a primary concern, the project emphasized creating a secure and efficient system for managing data and user interactions.
